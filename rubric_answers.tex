    \section{Problems Encountered in the Map}
        The first problem I encountered was that even very simple code was
        taking a long time to run and using a lot of memory. I discovered that
        the \texttt{iterparse} function still builds an entire tree in memory unless
        you clear the elements after processing them. This was helpful, although
        even after this even simple programs took a few minutes to complete.
    \section{Overview of the Data}
        \subsection{Output from initial cleaning programs}
            The \texttt{count\_tags.py} program output
            \verb"{'nd': 23, 'node': 17, 'tag': 11, 'way': 2}" after processing over
            5 million items. Something is wrong...
